# whereToWatch
Web app that allows you check in which country movie/tv series is available on netflix (global search for netflix)

Technologies used to build site: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
My main goal for this project was to build real world app in model–view–controller architecture and to use everthing I learned so far.
So for example I used classes for viev section where I have one main View class and whole section is based on class inheritance.
